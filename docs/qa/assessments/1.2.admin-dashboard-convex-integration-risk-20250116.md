## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Admin Authorization Bypass
**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability**: High (3) - New admin functions without established auth patterns

- Admin dashboard queries
- Content management mutations

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement mandatory admin role verification in ALL admin functions
- Use existing AdminAuthWrapper patterns for consistency
- Add audit logging for all admin operations
- Test unauthorized access scenarios comprehensively

**Testing Focus**: 
- Penetration testing of admin endpoints
- Role escalation attack scenarios
- Session hijacking prevention validation

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests (P0)
1. **Authorization Testing**:
   - Test admin function access without proper roles
   - Verify organization membership validation
   - Test session timeout and re-authentication
   - Validate audit logging for all admin operations

2. **Performance Load Testing**:
   - Stress test dashboard metrics aggregation
   - Test real-time subscription performance under load
   - Validate query caching effectiveness

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests (P1)
1. **Audit Trail Validation**:
   - Verify complete audit logging coverage
   - Test audit log integrity and immutability
   - Validate real-time monitoring alerts

2. **Integration Security Tests**:
   - Input validation testing for admin CRUD operations
   - XSS and injection attack prevention
   - Error handling security (no information leakage)

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests (P2)
1. **Functional Tests**:
   - Standard admin dashboard functionality
   - Real-time data update accuracy
   - Error state handling and recovery

2. **Performance Tests**:
   - Bundle size impact measurement
   - Memory leak detection in subscriptions
   - Component render optimization validation

- **Feature Flags**: Use flags for risky admin operations
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for admin function performance and errors
- **Rollback Plan**: Quick disable mechanism for problematic admin functions

### 4. Post-Deployment Monitoring
**Security Metrics**:
- Failed admin authentication attempts
- Unauthorized admin function access attempts
- Audit log completeness and integrity

**Performance Metrics**:
- Admin query response times
- Real-time subscription performance
- Memory usage trends in admin dashboard

**Business Metrics**:
- Admin user productivity metrics
- Dashboard usage patterns
- Error rates and user feedback

## Integration with Quality Gates

**Risk Score: 52/100** → **Gate Recommendation: CONCERNS**

**Reasoning**: One critical security risk (SEC-001) and multiple high-risk areas require attention before production deployment. However, risks are well-identified with clear mitigation strategies.

**Gate Conditions**:
- ✅ **PASS**: After SEC-001 mitigation and P0 test completion
- ⚠️ **CONCERNS**: Current state - deploy with enhanced monitoring
- ❌ **FAIL**: If authorization bypass remains unmitigated

## Risk Review Triggers

Update this risk profile when:
- New admin functions added beyond original scope
- Authentication patterns change in the application
- Performance issues reported in existing admin features
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in Convex or Clerk
- Compliance requirements change for audit logging
